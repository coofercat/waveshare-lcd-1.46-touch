## Shopping list
My device works as a fridge magenet, so I put shopping list in the middle.
Find the text sensor from the device, and create below automation in HA to sync shopping list item through.
```yaml
alias: Update Shopping list for waveshare list.

  - trigger: time_pattern

        {% if items | length > 0 %}     
          {{ '\u2022 ' ~ (items | map(attribute='summary') | list | join('\n\u2022 ')) }}
